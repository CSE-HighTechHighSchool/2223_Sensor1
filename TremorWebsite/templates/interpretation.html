      <h2>What is EMG?</h2>
      <p>EMG (Electromyography) is a technique used to measure the electrical activity of muscles. This technique is used to assess the health of muscles and the nerve cells that control them. EMG data can be used to diagnose a variety of neuromuscular disorders, including carpal tunnel syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and muscular dystrophy. EMG data can also be used to assess muscle function and performance, such as in sports and rehabilitation settings.</p>
